This project demonstrates a finger-controlled LED system using Arduino. The system allows users to control the illumination of LEDs using finger gestures captured by a sensor. By moving their finger in front of the sensor, users can toggle the LEDs on or off, creating an interactive lighting experience.

Features
Gesture Recognition: The system utilizes a sensor to recognize finger gestures for controlling the LEDs.
LED Illumination: LEDs are connected to the Arduino board and can be turned on or off based on the detected finger gestures.
Customizable: The code can be easily modified to adjust sensitivity, add more LEDs, or implement different gesture controls.
Hardware Requirements
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Gesture sensor (e.g., IR proximity sensor)
LEDs
Resistors
Breadboard
Jumper wires
